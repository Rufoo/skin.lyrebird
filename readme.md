THANKS AND CREDITS:

	** @Braz
		- For creating Mimic, the code of which is the basis for Lyrebird. Thank you for your blessing in starting this project.
		
	** @Wintermute0110
		- For his continual work on Advanced Emulator Launcher and its sister projects. For always being somebody who has tolerated the whimsical nature of
		  my development projects. Generally being an all around ace guy and someone who actively takes time to help out.
		  
	** @Chrisism
		- For always being helpful and humble, contibuting silently in the background to Advanced Emulator Launcher and starting up the Game Studios flag collection
		  which Lyrebird makes use of. Top guy who never seeks thanks but deserves it. =)
		  
	** @Paradix
		- For your work on Cirrus Extended 3 back in the day, without it there wouldn't have been a beginning and without your initial encouragement back then things
		  wouldn't be where they are now. Wherever you are in life, hope everything is roses. Cheers, bud.
		  
	** @Keibertz
		- For creating a mod for Cirrus Extended (http://myxbmc.bplaced.net/blog/?p=736) that was far too nice to remain as obscure as the location it was found in.
		  The design formed the start of the Keibertz view in Lyrebird, the name derived in honor of its origins.
		  
	** @Jondar
		- For contibuting the fix to add Australian classification flags. Appreciate you saving me the time in doing so and giving back to the project.
		
	** @Rdyott & @Gman12
		- For your continued interest and enthusiasm for the project.
