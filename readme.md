## Lyrebird Rmod ##

`Lyrebirds are ground-dwelling birds that are native to Australia. They are known for their
noteworthy mimicking abilities.`

Lyrebird Rmod is a fork from Lyrebird which is a fork of Mimic.

This mod adds the following features:

1.  This has some updates to the PVR guide to display the Show poster, rather than the channel icon.

2.  This supports the weather.noaa (https://github.com/randallspicher/weather.noaa) weather plugin, which fetches weather reports from the National Weather Service https://www.weather.gov (eg NOAA).  weather.gov provides seperate forecasts for Days and Nights, rather than just one per day.   It also provides much more verbose forecasts, so there's now a Detailed weather screen. In addition, there is the option to display the weather.gov weather icons (which are much more expansive than Kodi's icons, and include things like the % chance of rain on them)

3. There's a feature to display the Actor-Role based images (ala thetvdb.com images), that is, show a different character image of the actor in that TV show (or Movie), instead of always showing the same generic image that Kodi scrapes.  Note, that this is accomplished by placing images in a static directory (currently hard-coded to /media-share/People),  where the image name is  Actor - Role.jpg.  The actor name and role must match what kodi has in the database for that actor's name and role.  In many cases, this will require using .nfo files to "clean up" many of the names to clean out chars which cannot be used in filenames, such as when thetvdb uses a / to display multiple roles, "Some Actor as Joe/Bob/Bob's Ghost" 

For example:,  
  *   /media-share/People/Bruce Campbell - Ash Williams.jpg
  *   /media-share/People/Bruce Campbell - Autolycus.jpg
  *   /media-share/People/Bruce Campbell - Brisco County Jr..jpg
  *   /media-share/People/Bruce Campbell - Final Shemp.jpg
  *   /media-share/People/Bruce Campbell - Jack Stiles.jpg

	** @Keibertz
